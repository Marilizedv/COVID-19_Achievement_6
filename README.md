# COVID-19_Achievement_6
Scripts and data used for a project as part of  the Data Immersion Course at CareerFoundry
## Project Description
The pandemic has been in the news since the beginning of 2020 and I have been interested in how countries are affected. The data of this pandemic has been available publicly since it is a global concern. I am also interested in determining how countries are progressing with the COVID-19 vaccination rollouts, which countries are using which vaccines and if the vaccines have had an effect on cases and deaths. I chose this topic since I am very interested in health statistics/data, coming from a health industry background.
## Key Questions Answered using Python Coding
1.	Which countries are using which vaccines? (not answered with Pyhron but with Tableau)
2.	How has the vaccine rollouts been progressing in each country?
3.	Which countries are more advanced and why?
4.	Which countries had the first batch of vaccines?
5.	I would also want to know what the effect of the vaccines have been on the COVID-19 situation worldwide?
6.	Which countries were hit the hardest with covid-19 deaths/cases?
7.	Which, if any, factors have been a driving force for vaccine rollouts in each country?
## Data Sets
I used open source datasets. The vaccination dataset and new combined dataset are collected, aggregated, and cumulated by Our World in Data. They collect the data from official reports from governmental institutes in each country as well as the World Health Organization. They have been collecting and updating the dataset since vaccine rollouts started (end of 2020/beginning of 2021). The Population dataset I first used to merge with the vaccination dataset was sourced from the UN. I later decided to rather use a complete dataset from Our World in Data.

## Descriptions of Folders
- **01_Project_Management:** This folder contains the Project Brief (business questions related to the project, analysis, expectations etc.)
- **02_Data:** This folder contains the original datasets as well as Prepared Datasets after wrangling, cleaning and consistency checks, newly derived variables, and combined into one final dataset. The prepared datasets were exported after each step was completed.
- **03_Scripts:** This folder contains all my Jupyter Scripts with Python Codes necessary to complete the project.
